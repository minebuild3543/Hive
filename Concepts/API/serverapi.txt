Hive System: Server API:
------------------------

This is the API and what I will be building into the server's core functions, please note if you want to add something just add it in and I shall look at how to implement it.

Functions are split into core, jobs, turtles, destinations, clients, servers, gps, sos, ssh, etc.
---
Protocols are used via pocket computers, and some clients and don't always use the following, the below is just a display to see your ideas.
---
PROTOCOL NAME -> Name -> DESCRIPTION
---
COR -> Core -> These are core functions and are built straight into the base code of the hive server.
RQT -> Requests -> These are request functions and are what is used to actually ask for a job to be completed.
JOB -> Jobs -> These are for jobs, this could be assigning, adding, deleting, etc.
TRT -> Turtles -> This is for interacting with turtles, and getting statuses.
DST -> Destinations -> This is for interacting with destinations and getting, adding, deleting and editing.
CLT -> Clients -> This for connecting to clients that are around, and getting information about them.
SRV -> Servers -> This is for connectivity with servers.
GPS -> Global Positioning System -> This is for the GPS system and for turtles to get around.
SOS -> Save Our Souls (HELP) -> This is the help mode and will be talked to as soon as a problem arises.
SSH -> Secure Shell -> This is for connecting to turtles securely.

-----------------------
Format: function name -> arguments -> return
=======================================================
Glossary:
---------
hivecode -> This is the code for your private hive, a public hive will assign a private hive one.
streamid -> This is the protocol and passkey your client will use to talk to the server when you start assigning tasks.
username -> This is a username that you will set on startup to allow only you access to high level commands.
password -> This is a password that you will set on startup to allow only you access to high level commands.
protocol -> This is a protocol that we use as normal rednet is too open therefore we have to restrict access for other computers to hack in.
jobpcsid -> This is a job process id and will be the id that you get when you request a job

API FUNCTIONS::::
=======================================================
(FORMAT: function - arguments - return) (All functions will return false if failed, nothing else, check server log for details)

hive_core_requestunpair -> username, password, hivecode, streamid -> "true"

Request:
---
